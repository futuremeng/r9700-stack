# The Monitor and About pages (serve/webui.py, serve/web)

A web front end for a running `serve/` launch: what the engine is, what the cards are doing, and — if
you put it in the path — every request that went through. The layout is ported from
[Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata)'s web app (MIT; see [CREDITS.md](../CREDITS.md)), whose
Monitor and About views are the shape we wanted. The parts that Strata's server could answer from
inside and ours cannot are said out loud on the page instead of being guessed at.

```
bash serve/webui.sh                 # watch the serve on 8080 from http://127.0.0.1:8081/monitor
WEBUI=1 bash serve/serve.sh         # the same, started for you, with this launch's recipe on About
WEBUI_MODE=proxy bash serve/webui.sh   # also relay /v1/*, which is what fills the request list
```

## Why a sidecar, and what it costs

Stock vLLM has **no per-request API**. It has `/health`, `/v1/models` and `/metrics` — the last a set of
cumulative counters, not a history. Strata's Monitor can list every request because Strata's server
keeps those records in its own process; here, nothing does. So:

| mode | what it does | what it costs |
|---|---|---|
| `observe` (default) | `GET /health`, `/v1/models`, `/metrics` every `POLL_S` (2 s), plus amdgpu sysfs reads | nothing in the inference path at all; the request list stays empty and the page says why |
| `--proxy` | the same, plus it relays API traffic and records it | one extra TCP hop and one thread per in-flight request. Not measured against a stock launch yet — do not read a run through it as a baseline |

Request records (input, output, reasoning, wall-clock, first token, token counts) exist **only** in
`--proxy`, and only for the traffic that came through this port. `--key` guards the API and the relay
(not the HTML, which holds nothing): without it an open relay to a keyed upstream is worse than no
monitor.

## Where each number comes from

| page number | source |
|---|---|
| model, served name | `GET /v1/models` |
| KV pool in tokens, block size, TP/PP, max context, KV dtype, scheduler | the **labels** of vLLM's own `/metrics` series (`cache_config_info` and friends) — vLLM publishes its configuration nowhere else; which labels exist moves between releases, so a dash means this build does not publish it |
| running / waiting / swapped / KV pool used % | gauges `vllm:num_requests_*`, `vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc` — **max over ranks** for the gauge (`sum` would say 112% when two ranks are at 56%; the sentence that matters is "the worst rank is at X") |
| tok/s, req/min, prompt tok/s | counter deltas over the poll window (`generation_tokens_total`, `prompt_tokens_total`, `e2e_request_latency_seconds_count`) |
| first token, queue, prefill, decode means | `_sum`/`_count` deltas of `time_to_first_token_seconds`, `request_queue_time_seconds`, `request_prefill_time_seconds`, `request_decode_time_seconds` (`bench/ttft_breakdown.py` reads the same family) |
| speculation acceptance %, drafts/request | `spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total` ÷ `spec_decode_num_draft_tokens_total` (the older builds only have `..._num_drafts_total`, which gives drafts per request but not the token ratio) |
| tokens per engine step, steps per request | `iteration_tokens_total_{sum,count}` |
| prefix cache hits % | `prefix_cache_hits_total` ÷ `prefix_cache_queries_total` |
| card busy % / VRAM / temperature / sclk / mclk | `/sys/class/drm/card*/device` (`gpu_busy_percent`, `mem_info_*`, `hwmon*/{temp1_input,power1_average}`, `hwmon*/freq*_label` matched by `sclk`/`mclk`, not by index) |
| the launch recipe on About | the meta file `serve/serve.sh` writes when `WEBUI=1` (`--meta`), not something inferred |

**What cannot be answered per request:** queue wait and the prefill/decode split. vLLM counts those in
aggregate, so the Monitor shows them as window means under "Engine timings" and the per-request rows
carry a dash. For the real per-request breakdown use `bench/ttft_breakdown.py`, which differences
`/metrics` around a controlled set of requests.

## Cards: what sysfs refuses on this box

Measured 2026-11-02, on the four-R9700 host with nothing running on the cards:

```
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/gpu_busy_percent   -> Device or resource busy
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon2/temp1_input -> Device or resource busy   (all temp/power/freq too)
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_vram_used -> 59916288                  (fine)
```

so the reader never reports a refused attribute as zero: the card block names what it could not read.
`SMI=1` additionally calls `rocm-smi --showuse --showmeminfo vram --showtemp --showpower --showclocks
--showproductname --json` and fills only the gaps, joining by **PCI bus id** (`PCI_SLOT_NAME` in
`uevent` vs `PCI Bus` in rocm-smi) because rocm-smi's `card0` is not the sysfs's `card0`. That is
opt-in for a reason: rocm-smi opens `/dev/kfd` on every call, which on a box you are measuring is a
perturbation, not a read. Keep it off during gates and soaks; keep it on when you want the clocks.
`power_w`/`temp_c` come back `N/A` from rocm-smi in the state this box was in after the
watchdog/PSU events ([notes/incident-2026-11-02/](incident-2026-11-02)) — dropped, not zeroed.

## Endpoints

```
GET /                     Monitor          GET /web/<file>      this page's own assets
GET /monitor  /about      the two pages    GET /healthz         the sidecar's own state
GET /api/status           engine config + live + per-window rates + history + cards + host + meta
GET /api/requests         the retained list (last --keep, newest first)
GET /api/requests?id=...  one request, with input/output/reasoning/response (256 KiB each, flagged)
GET /api/host             CPU, threads, RAM, kernel, uptime
```

Everything else is relayed to the upstream. Nothing is written to disk; the list is memory and dies
with the process. `--keep 100` default, `--poll 2` default.

## Tests

`tests/test_webui.py` (89 checks, no GPU and no network needed):

- `/metrics` collapsing: buckets skipped, counters summed over ranks, gauges taken as max, KV capacity
  and configuration read out of labels, and a counter that did not move reporting *no data* rather
  than zero — the first window after a start has no window, and dividing the whole run's counters by
  0.001 s is a number this box generates enough of already.
- the request ring: eviction, the fields the list carries (never the bodies), the 256 KiB truncation
  flag, decode speed from `usage` versus an estimated token count (and the flag saying which).
- the sysfs reader against a fake tree, including a card whose `gpu_busy_percent` refuses to answer.
- rocm-smi parsing out through its banner, joined by PCI bus id, filling only gaps, and an unknown
  card becoming its own row.
- end to end against a fake vLLM: SSE relayed byte for byte, first-token stamp and wall-clock from
  the stream that passed, `usage` from the final chunk, a 500 relayed as it was and recorded as an
  error, `observe` relaying while recording nothing, the `--key` gate on both the API and the relay,
  `/web/../` traversal refused (a plain `startswith` check would have served this file: `serve/webui.py`
  starts with `serve/web`), and the pages' ids/assets/CSS variables cross-checked against the HTML so a
  renamed id fails a test instead of blanking a card.

## What the relay costs, and what recording costs

`bench/webui_ab.py` runs the same requests through three arms in one process: `direct` (the serve),
`relay` (the sidecar in observe mode, which only forwards) and `record` (proxy mode, which also parses
the SSE deltas as they pass), at three prompt tiers (`--tiers 45,1500,3000`) and two shapes
(`--shape first|stream|all`). The tier is the axis that matters: the hop is a fixed cost, so its
**share** of a request should fall as the prompt grows. Against a **loopback stand-in that answers in
~0 ms** -- so the milliseconds are ours, and its prefill cost is a fiction, ignore its % column --
the hop stays flat while the prompt grows 45 -> 1200 tokens:

| shape | arm | median | first token | tok/s | vs direct |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `max_tokens=1` (the whole request is ~1 ms) | direct | 0.92 ms | 0.89 ms | — | — |
| | relay | 1.86 ms | 1.86 ms | — | **+0.95 ms** |
| | record | 1.85 ms | 1.84 ms | — | +0.93 ms |
| streamed 64 tokens (~272 ms) | direct | 271.5 ms | 203.5 ms | 235.7 | — |
| | relay | 273.3 ms | 205.0 ms | 234.3 | +1.74 ms (+0.6%) |
| | record | 273.0 ms | 204.9 ms | 234.5 | +1.46 ms (+0.5%) |

Across tiers (streamed 64 tokens, stand-in, `--n 8`): **+1.3-1.7 ms** at 45 tokens, **+1.8-2.1 ms** at
600, **+1.3-1.6 ms** at 1200 -- flat, which is the whole argument: the hop does not scale with the
prompt, so its share falls as the request gets longer.

So: about **1 ms per request** for the hop (one extra loopback connection and a thread), flat in
prompt length, and **recording is free inside that** -- relay and record are within noise of each
other, because the delta parsing happens on bytes that were already being copied. Against a real
launch, where a request costs 100-4000 ms, that is ~0.1% and it will not move a gate. This is the
floor, not the serve's number: the live A/B is still owed --

```
python3 bench/webui_ab.py http://127.0.0.1:8080 --n 10        # warmed, box otherwise idle; ~10 min
```

the container was not reachable from the shell that wrote this (`docker` not on PATH, `sudo` wants a
password), and the box had just rebooted, so nothing was serving.

Writing that script found a bug worth recording: the pump used `res.read(8192)`, and on a body with no
Content-Length `read(n)` **blocks until n bytes or EOF**. A 300-byte-per-second stream therefore reached
the client entirely at the end -- first token +70 ms on a 272 ms request, which would have made every
first-token number the page shows a lie. It reads `res.read1()` now, and a check in
`tests/test_webui.py` asserts the client's first bytes arrive while the upstream is still generating
(it fails with the old call: `first bytes at 0.48s of 0.48s`).


## Limits, on purpose

- The relay is a monitor, not a load balancer: SSE responses close the connection (`Connection: close`)
  rather than being re-framed, and one upstream connection is opened per request.
- No per-request queue/prefill/decode split (see above), no cancellation UI, no chat tab.
- `--proxy` measures token counts as *deltas seen* when the client did not ask vLLM for a `usage`
  block, and the detail pane says `≈ estimated` when it had to.
